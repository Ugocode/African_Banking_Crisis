The data was so I used SMOTE to upsample the data 

#Insights

From what we can seein this project Systemic_crisis is a major cause of banking crisis in Africa. So when govenments and govenment institutions making monetry polices fail, there is a very high likelyhood that there will be banking crises in the country.

This is followed by Exchange rate to the US dollar and the rise of inflation in the country.

so govenment should watch how their monitary polices are created and implimented to avert crises
